* Copy shortened URL. This can also be activated by pressing Enter from the URLs list.
* A readonly box showing details about the selected URL.
* Set of controls to shorten a new URL: Provide the new URL; optionally, you can set a display name and a custom subfix for the shortened URL. Finally, press the Shorten URL button.
* Rename: opens a dialog to provide a new name to display the selected URL on the list.
* Delete: opens a dialog to delete the selected URL.
